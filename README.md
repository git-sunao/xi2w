# xi2w
A method to compute the projected two correlation from the anisotropic power spectrum.
This method is based on the multipole decomposition of anisotropic power spectrum,
the relation to the real space multipoles, and FFTLog.

This is useful for projected 2pcf with RSD or IA effects which produce anisotropy.

See [xi2w.ipynb](xi2w.ipynb) for the numerical implementation example.
